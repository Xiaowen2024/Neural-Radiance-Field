# Neural-Radiance-Field

A neural radiance field is a fully connected network trained to reproduce input views of a single scene using a rendering loss. In this project, I used Neural Radiance Field to generate 3D scenes from a set of 2D images. I first trained and tested a neural network to reconstruct 2D images and then defined more utility functions such as volume rendering to help with 3D image reconstruction.
